# Helping Hand: A Food Waste Management Application

## Abstract

The project aims on developing a mobile application (app) that extends a universal platform wherein NGOs/Donors can identify available food resources in the locality and help the needy people with that food, thereby reducing hunger and wastage of food. It has been identified the use of technology to reduce food waste management and built an application that allows restaurants to donate and share their foods and leftovers with people in need. This work enhances both the sectors healthcare and the environment by reducing wastage of food and also lowering the number of hungry people.

The idea is to develop a two-side application where NGOs and Restaurants can communicate and help the needy. On the side of the NGO, they will be provided with the list of restaurants available with the food and its quantity. NGO can make a request to the restaurant and get the required food. On the other hand, restaurants can update the availability of food at their place and will have the feature to verify the order with the NGO. Furthermore. restaurants will be provided with data visualization charts which will help them to analyze how much excess food is cooked or the quantity of food is excess so that the customers arenâ€™t able to finish it. With the help of such metrics, restaurants will make sure how much food is to be prepared depending on the no. of customers and hence reduce food wastage.
